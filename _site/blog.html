      <p><p>The browser debate is heated debate and is something I am heavily invested in. With the browser being one of the most used tools on your system I find it important to be using the right browser for your needs. I have been testing and changing browsers for a few years now. Currently I am using Firefox and I’m really enjoying it. In this post I will go through some of the feature I cannot live without and some of the things I don’t like.</p>
