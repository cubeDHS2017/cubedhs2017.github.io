        <h1>My Experience with Supabase</h1>
        <p>I recently finished up a quick project for an assignment. I had to make a simple app that utilizes a database. I wrote the app in React Native using the Expo framework. The actual writing of the app I was not worried about. It was the database that I was worried about. I have a homelab with PostgreSQL running. I could have used that but I would have needed to figure out getting that accesible from outside of my home network. Instead of doing that I chose to use Supabase.</p>

<p>Since I was using the free plan of Supabase I thought that it was going to hurt me but actually it was very pleasant. I very quickly create two tables. The Supabase interface is very pleasant and easy to work with. I find it much better and easier to work with then the PGAdmin4 interface.</p>

<p>After creating my two tables I was able to very quickly setup foreign keys. Now it was time to setup my API key. To authenticate you just need the Supabase project URL and key.</p>

<p>Even with me wanting to use self hosted infrastructure I think there is a time and a place for IAaS. For example, this was just a simple project that took me about 10 hours to write. If I used my own self hosted database I would have increased the length of the project by at least a hour or two.</p>

<p>There are many platforms that offer a database. The reason that I went with Supabase over other competitors was because it is open source and self hostable. While I did not use the self hosted option I like having that flexibility so that if my needs grow and I want to continue using Supabase rather then my own database I am able to self host it rather then pay Supabase to host it.</p>

<p>Overall I am happy that I used Supabase because now I have experience with it. I think it is good practice to try new things because it not only teaches you more but it lets you maybe find something that works better. For now I am going to continue using PostgreSQL for all my projects but Supabase was a nice choice for this project and is a viable option for future projects.</p>
