<h3 id="introduction">Introduction:</h3>
<p>I am a hoarder and I also love data. Because of that when I saw Bryan
Jenk’s health dashboard I immediately fell in love with the concept and
started working on my own version. If you have not already see Jenk’s
setup I would advise you to give his YouTube video showcasing it a
watch. He has a much more robust system with live data.</p>
<h3 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h3>
<p>Before I was able to make those beautiful Grafana dashboards I need
data. I chose to host a PostgreSQL database in my homelab to hold all my
data. Then Jenk’s uses a very helpful tool called n8n to collect his
data and manipulate it before adding it into his database. This is a no
code tool that is really similar to scratch in how you setup your
workflow. I will be writing a future blog about this amazing tool and my
many uses. This tool has some amazing APIs built in nativly but I chose
to setup my system a little differently.</p>
<h4 id="weight-data">Weight Data</h4>
<p>One of the metrics that I am tracking is my weight. I decided that
since n8n has a nice little feature for doing a form I would use that to
collect my weight data. The form feature is like a little google form
which is self hosted on my server. Then every time I insert data into
it, n8n takes my weight and the time that the form is submitted and then
adds that data into my PostgreSQL table dedicated to my weights. It then
sends me a discord notification letting me know that the data transfer
was successful.</p>
<h4 id="google-fit-data">Google Fit Data</h4>
<p>Since I am a pixel user all my health data that my phone collects is
inside of Google Fit. Unfortunately they recently shutdown their old API
for accessing that data and now have a new one that is less accessible.
To use this new API you need to be an Android App. There is an app {{app
that exports google fit}} that works and is able to export your data but
it is paid. Since I don’t like spending money I decided to take a
different route. First I thought that I was going to be able to build a
simple little Android app but quickly realized that would take some time
so I put that on hold and went for a simpler solution. Unfortunately
this way is not able to be as easily automated. it relies on the Google
Export function that is part of every google account. I just go to my
page and download all my Google Fit data. Then I take that data and grab
the .csv file that contains all my calorie, mileage, and step data and
use n8n to parce it and then insert the data into my PostgreSQL
database. Since this is not automated I only do this every few weeks but
I am still able to have my data in my database if my Google account was
ever deleted or if Google stopped letting people download their
data.</p>
<h4 id="strava-data">Strava Data</h4>
<p>Now for the workout data. Since I recently started running I have my
data from my runs. Strava has an API which n8n nativelly supports but it
does not provided the data I need. Strava much like Google lets one
download their data which is what I do. Then using n8n I parce the data
and insert it into yet another PostgreSQL table. Strava also gives me
the GPS data from each of my runs and I would love to find a way to
store that in my database and create heat-maps of everywhere I have run
in Grafana but have not figured that out yet because this dashboard is
still a work in progress.</p>
<h4 id="strong-data">Strong Data</h4>
<p>Finally, I do my weight lifting and other workouts using the strong
app to record each workout. The Strong app provides a way to export all
your data also which then lets n8n parce ir and add it to a PostgreSQL
table.</p>
<h4 id="n8n">n8n</h4>
<p>Since each of these utilizes n8n I thought it good to do a quick
little explanation on how I set each workflow up and how to use n8n. I
am working on another blog post about n8n and it’s many uses. One might
wonder why I chose to use n8n for my backend coding instead of a
language like python. My first answer is because that is what Jenk’s
uses. Secondly, because it is super easy to make the different parts
work together. It is also really easy to setup and get working so I
don’t have to sink a bunch of time into programming the back-end.</p>
<p>In n8n each program is called a workflow so I have a different
workflow for each data source that I process. Then each workflow starts
with a trigger. The one that collects my weight that one starts when a
form is submitted in the form that I am hosting. Then the others as of
right now I manually trigger them when I do my data exporting from the
different sources.</p>
<p>Inside of n8n there is a node that handles the retrieval of data from
the .csv file and also another node that handles the connection to the
PostgreSQL database. Then I also utilize a discord node that sends me
notifications telling me that the operation was successful.</p>
<h3 id="grafana">Grafana</h3>
<p>Then the final stop for my data is the Grafana dashboards. This is
where I am able to take a look at all my data and have a bird’s eye view
of each of my health metrics. Grafana is amazing because there are so
many different graph types. The beautiful thing is that each of these
different {{name}} is all defined by a simple SQL query. That makes the
data manipulation inside of Grafana almost endless.</p>
<p>I have xy graphs that show my weight, distance walked, water intake,
and many other things.</p>
