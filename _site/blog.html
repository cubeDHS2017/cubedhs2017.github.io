              <p><p>I recently finished up a quick project for an assignment. I had to make a simple app that utilizes a database. I wrote the app in React Native using the Expo framework. The actual writing of the app I was not worried about. It was the database that I was worried about. I have a homelab with PostgreSQL running. I could have used that but I would have needed to figure out getting that accesible from outside of my home network. Instead of doing that I chose to use Supabase.</p>
