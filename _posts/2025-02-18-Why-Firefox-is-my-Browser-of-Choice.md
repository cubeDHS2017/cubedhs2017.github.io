title:  "Why Firefox is my browser of choice"
tags: Software
---
The browser debate is heated debate and is something I am heavily invested in. With the browser being one of the most used tools on your system I find it important to be using the right browser for your needs. I have been testing and changing browsers for a few years now. Currently I am using Firefox and I'm really enjoying it. In this post I will go through some of the feature I cannot live without and some of the things I don't like.


This is my blog post that I am working on right now.

``` python
print("hello world")
if debug ==0:
	print("nice")
x = 4
```


{% highlight javascript %}
function sayHello(name) {
  if (!name) {
    console.log('Hello World');
  } else {
    console.log(`Hello ${name}`);
  }  
}  
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
{% endhighlight %}
